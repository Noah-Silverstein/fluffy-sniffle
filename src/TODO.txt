- add resource capabilities to worlds
- add button functionality  -> one button should move planets to their actual orbits
                            -> one button should bring up a list of planets in the system
                            -> maybe we can change the context of the middle button depending on what we've selected 
- add resource panel
- fix camera
- move scaling to drawer and add change scaling function to drawer
- Highlights are ugly as fuck maybe remove


-------------------
Framing idea:
contacted by alien, instructions to build something
to build that requires resources not found on earth

have research as a resource that unlocks new harvesting abilities
perhaps have alien tech 

-> need to get resources from other planets

eventual end game is creating a warp ship to another star(randomized)
repeat the loop but with info already gained. New aspect trade with alien civ
-> repeat?

-> second end game new universe --> you could assign different elements
